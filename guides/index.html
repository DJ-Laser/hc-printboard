    <h2 class="headline">First, Think of a idea!</h2>
    <p>
      To build something, you need an idea! Think about what you would like to display on your pegboard, once you get one.
      What is something you always lose and need a place to store? What do you think would look really cool hung up on a wall?

  <p>
    First, choose and download your software (or sign up if your using a web based one), then install wakatime for your platform of choice
    Wakatime for most desktop CAD softwares: <a href="https://github.com/iamawatermelo/wakapi-anyide">Wakatime AnyIDE</a> 
    Wakatime for onshape: <a href="https://github.com/JeffreyWangDev/onshape-wakatime">Onshape Wakatime</a>
