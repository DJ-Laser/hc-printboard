    <p>
        The Ikea Skadis is a 30 by 22 inch wooden board with many holes for you to connect your designs to the wall. It is often used by 3D Modelers and hackers to easily connect prints to the wall without needing screws or adhesives.

        <ol type="1">
            <li>Your submisson must be unique. If a similar 3d model already exists (check on sites like thingiverse) you will be asked to clarify what makes yours better</li>
            <li>Your submisson must have a purpose and solve a problem.</li>
            <li>You must be 18 or under.</li>
